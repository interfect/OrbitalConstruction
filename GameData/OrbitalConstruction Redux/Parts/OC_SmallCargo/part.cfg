    description = After several SpaceDock resupply flights failed to reach orbit and crash-landed in Krussia, the engineers at Orbital ConstructoCorp came up with a brilliant new idea: put fewer Rocket Parts on the rocket. This module is the culmination of a five-year research project dedicated to making that idea a reality.
